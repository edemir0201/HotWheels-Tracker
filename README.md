# HotWheels-Tracker

**This project is very much WIP and doesn't actually compile yet**

This is a program written in C as of now but eventually it will have a python version, it's main function is to receive hot wheels info and organize it in
various ways. It is basically a way to mess with sorting algorithms and different data structures while having the fun purpose of showing off a hot wheels
collection. Currently just setting file read/write to support "saving" states
